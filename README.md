Wonkavision
===========
Wonkavision is a lightweight library that allows you to easily define simple multi-dimensional data cubes on top of a star or snowflake shaped realtional database. Wonkavision is not intended to replace more full featured OLAP servers like Mondrian or Analysis Services, but rather provides a fast, flexible way to perform the most common types of multi-dimensional queries needed by business dashboards in your Ruby app. 

Wonkavision also supports an HTTP API helper that you can plug into Rails (or other Ruby based web framework). Two companion libraries, Wonkavision Client, a ruby HTTP client, and Wonkavision JS provide remote clients of the HTTP library for Ruby and JavaScript front ends respectively.
